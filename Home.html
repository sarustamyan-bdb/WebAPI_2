        There was a considerable learning curve for me to complete this evaluation.  Prior to this I had no experience with WebAPI or LINQ.
        Although I was able to cobble this together it only shows that I can learn  technologies that I have no prior experience with relatively quickly,
        not that I have general competence in these technologies. If the job requires extensive prior knowledge of WebAPI and LINQ then that should
        obviously be considered.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to keep the architecture as simple as possible for this evaluation I created an in-code DataTable to serve as the Local Data Store.
        The POST() command uses CSVHelper to load the CSV File Data, located in the Data folder into the DataTable, which is named DataStore.  I did not
        create a method to upload the file from the client browser via a file load control as that was not specified in the instructions.
        <br />
        <br />
        I created a method ValidateEmployeeManager() in the EmployeeController, but was unable to figure out how to translate the SQL Statement I came up with
        to perform the validation into a LINQ Statement. I tried a bunch of things, and then tried finding an Online Convert SQL to LINQ, but in fact, the one utility that
        I found turned out to be buggy, and didn't work, so I was left a bit mystified, and put the SQL Statement in the comments of that routine and assigned the 
        procedure to WIP.  I did this so that I could work on other parts of the project while I improve my understanding of LINQ.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once I got the idea of how WebAPI is structured I was able to make quick progress, but the initial learning curve was a bit steep.  I had little
        experience with MVC (I took a class on MVC in 2013), but was able to pick up the concepts reasonably quickly as the architectures are similar in nature,
        though I wound up in the weeds on certain points (especially on my first attempt where I created a WebAPI MVC project).
        I expect there's plenty about WebAPI that I still do not know.  What I will say is that I'm very glad I spent the time on this test to learn this material.
        It's very interesting and I can see how useful it would be in certain scenarios where exposing API to third parties is desirable.
        At NWNA, Blythedale, and Krasdale, we had no need to do so, and therefore I had no reason to study WebAPI before, so this was a great opporunity for me and I'm
        happy to take full advantage of it. I now feel I have enough understanding to work with WebAPI in a practical manner. Great.
        <br />
        <br />
        My impression of LINQ is that its syntax is something that requires a good deal of study and practice to get used to.  Frankly, I would normally choose to do SQL based processing
        in SQL Server via stored procedures and return the data results to the application code, rather than run SQL operations in ASP.Net code using LINQ as a general rule.
        The reason for this is that architecturally, I have always thought it best to keep business logic as far on the backend as possible so that you
        do not have to re-write logic as your interfaces change or are replaced over time.  In addition it typically results in lower maintenance as updates
        to business logic can take place in one spot, and then propogate out to whatever interfaces consume the data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although I could not complete the assignment in regards to LINQ this was a truly interesting challenge in multiple categories and I feel I learned a lot in a short time. Thanks!
